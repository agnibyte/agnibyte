## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agnibyte/agnibyte.github.io.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd agnibyte.github.io
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

## Configuration

### `next.config.js`

Ensure the configuration file (`next.config.js`) is properly set up. Common issues include:

- **Syntax Errors**: Ensure that you do not have duplicate variable declarations.
- **Deprecated Options**: Replace deprecated options like `images.domains` with `images.remotePatterns`.

### Port Conflicts

If the default port (3000) is in use, Next.js will try the next available port (3001, 3002, etc.). Ensure that these ports are not blocked or used by other applications.

## Common Issues

- **Port Already in Use**: If you see messages indicating that ports are in use, check if other applications are occupying these ports and close them if necessary.
- **Configuration Warnings**: Review and update your `next.config.js` file to resolve configuration warnings or errors.
